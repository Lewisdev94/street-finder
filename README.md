# Street Finder

A small app that finds a local street to walk to. The idea comes from finding new areas to explore during the Covid-19 UK lockdowns.

## Live Preview

The app is live [here](https://lewisdev94.github.io/street-finder/), hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Technologies

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Current Features

- Two selectable postcode areas to explore
- A small array of tasks to complete
- Map link opens to the street location in Google Maps. Also opens to the street location in the Maps App using Google API url parameters

## Future Improvements
- Redesign interface to be fully responsive. (Code taken from a previous non-mobile project)
- Admin backend to upload new postcode areas
- A larger array of tasks
- Replace hover selections with click selections
- Add a initial modal warning about exploring safely
